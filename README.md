## Dashboard 1: "Paradox of New Jersey"

This project is dedicated to analysis of US public transportation system on a state level. First dashboard delves into the paradoxical nature of New Jersey's public transportation. Through a state-level analysis of median commute times and transit usage percentages, we discover that despite longer commute times, New Jersey leads in transit usage among the top 5 states. The choice of median aggregation on a state level ensures fairness by mitigating the impact of population-dense outliers, presenting a more accurate representation of each state's transportation landscape.

## Dashboard 2: "County-Level Insights"

Building upon the first dashboard, this visualization explores the transit use percentage at the county level. Highlighting the top 5 states with transit usage, the map plot reveals the concentration of outlier counties, particularly in the northeast. A closer examination of the top 10 counties emphasizes that the seemingly high transit usage in New York State is skewed by outliers, reinforcing the significance of the chosen aggregation method.

## Dashboard 3: "Wealth, Transit, and Commute Choices"

The final dashboard investigates the relationship between poverty levels and public transportation usage, aiming to understand the dynamics between ownership and service-based transportation. Surprisingly, no positive correlation is found; instead, a weak negative correlation suggests that wealthier states exhibit higher public transportation usage. The alignment of the top 5 states by average income with the top 5 states in transit usage raises intriguing questions about the factors influencing transportation choices, leaving room for further investigation and exploration.
